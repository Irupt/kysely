     * This method is used to acquire a lock for the migrations so that
     * it's not possible for two migration operations to run in parallel.
     *
     * Most dialects have explicit locks that can be used, like advisory locks
     * in PostgreSQL and the get_lock function in MySQL.
     *
     * If the dialect doesn't have explicit locks the {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockTable}
     * created by Kysely can be used instead. You can access it through the `options` object.
     * The lock table has two columns `id` and `is_locked` and there's only one row in the table
     * whose id is {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockRowId}. `is_locked` is an integer. Kysely
     * takes care of creating the lock table and inserting the one single row to it before this
     * method is executed. If the dialect supports schemas and the user has specified a custom
     * schema in their migration settings, the options object also contains the schema name in
     * {@link MigrationLockOptions.lockTableSchema}.
     *
     * Here's an example of how you might implement this method for a dialect that doesn't
     * have explicit locks but supports `FOR UPDATE` row locks and transactional DDL:
     *
     * ```ts
     * {
     *   async acquireMigrationLock(db, options): Promise<void> {
     *     const queryDb = options.lockTableSchema
     *       ? db.withSchema(options.lockTableSchema)
     *       : db
     *
     *     // Since our imaginary dialect supports transactional DDL and has
     *     // row locks, we can simply take a row lock here and it will guarantee
     *     // all subsequent calls to this method from other transactions will
     *     // wait until this transaction finishes.
     *     await queryDb
     *       .selectFrom(options.lockTable)
     *       .selectAll()
     *       .where('id', '=', options.lockRowId)
     *       .forUpdate()
     *       .execute()
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * If `supportsTransactionalDdl` is `true` then the `db` passed to this method
     * is a transaction inside which the migrations will be executed. Otherwise
     * `db` is a single connection (session) that will be used to execute the
     * migrations.
     */
